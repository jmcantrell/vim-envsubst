INTRODUCTION                                      *envsubst* *envsubst.vim*

Intended as a companion to the GNU gettext command of the same name, this
plugin provides commands and mappings to substitute the values of environment
variables of the form $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} in a buffer.

CONFIGURATION                                     *envsubst-configuration*

g:envsubst_loaded                                 *g:envsubst_loaded*
    If set in your |vimrc|, envsubst.vim is not loaded.

g:envsubst_trigger_next                           *g:envsubst_trigger_next*
    A |String| representing the key to use when selecting the next environment
    variable for substitution.

g:envsubst_trigger_prev                           *g:envsubst_trigger_prev*
    A |String| representing the key to use when selecting the previous
    environment variable for substitution.

Setting either of the previous two trigger variables will conveniently create
mappings for the corresponding |mapmode-n|, |mapmode-i|, and |mapmode-s|
|<Plug>|s (see |using-<Plug>|).

For example:
>
    let g:envsubst_trigger_next = "\<C-j>"
    let g:envsubst_trigger_prev = "\<C-k>"
<
Is equivalent to:
>
    nmap <C-j> <Plug>EnvSubstNext
    imap <C-j> <Plug>EnvSubstNext
    smap <C-j> <Plug>EnvSubstNext

    nmap <C-k> <Plug>EnvSubstPrev
    imap <C-k> <Plug>EnvSubstPrev
    smap <C-k> <Plug>EnvSubstPrev
<

COMMANDS                                          *envsubst-commands*

                                                  *:EnvSubst*
:[range]EnvSubst        Substitute environment variables in [range].
                        Non-existent variables will be left unchanged.

USAGE                                             *envsubst-usage*

Environment variables can be substituted automatically for a range using the
command |:EnvSubst| or interactively by using the trigger keys.

Depending on the trigger key used and if there are any variables found, the
next/previous one will be substituted with the existing value (if there is
one) and selected so that it can be typed over, if desired. The trigger key
can be continuously pressed to cycle through the variables or |<Esc>| pressed
to stop substitution.
